What does this fork do?
-----------------------

I've taken the Haxe port that [Adam Harte](https://github.com/adamharte) did and added some adapters to get it working with different game engines. For now it is working with:

* OpenFl
* Luxe
* Heaps
* Kha (It should work, but I couldn't test it)

Take a look to the `test_projects` folder to get the example of each adapter
